            <h3>A Cardinal Dispensation</h3>
            <p> This dispensation is so important because the Lord set a standard for His people and showed them very
                explicitly what He expected of them. This dispensation also contains many examples of the love of God.
                God wanted His people to be free and safe, so He called a prophet to lead them to safety. Today, God
                continues to call prophets that lead His people to a "promised land". The Lord will continue to call
                prophets until He returns to earth to reign forever.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Adam & Eve: Our First Parents</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile adameve" src="images/adam_eve-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <p class="w3-mobile">Adam and Eve were the first of God's children here on earth. As we know, Adam and Eve
                were forced out of the Garden of Eden after partaking of the forbidden fruit. This caused them to become
                mortal, susceptible to sickness, injury and worse; sin.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Luckily, the fall of Adam and Eve was part of God's plan. Satan was not aware that God
                had prepared for this to happen to Adam and Eve. God had already created a Plan of Salvation for Adam,
                Eve and all of His children that would ultimately be born on earth. This plan required Adam and Eve to
                have children, create and strengthen a relationship with God even though they were not in His presence,
                and finally, teach their children.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Today, we are part of the family that Adam and Eve created. We are still cut off from
                God's presence, but we do have a knowledge of Jesus Christ and God who is our Heavenly Father. Jesus
                Christ taught His Gospel long ago when He ministered here on earth. Adam and Eve were the first to learn
                of Christ's Gospel, and they even began to make promises and complete ordinances like baptism. Adam and
                Eve, over their life, learned to progress and become better people. This is the point of our lives.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Through the Plan of Salvation, we are able to fulfill all of the ordinances that God
                wants us to complete here on earth. We have Christ's Gospel to teach us how to act. As we strive to live
                righteously as Adam and Eve did, we can return to God's presence where we will no longer be cut off from
                Him.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Enoch, Noah & Melchizedek: The Fathers</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile enoch" src="images/noah_and_animals-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <h3>The Enochian Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">During the time that Enoch, Noah and Melchizedek were on the earth, there were an
                innumerable amount of wicked people. In fact, these wicked people began to persecute the righteous, and
                especially Noah. It just so happened that Enoch, a righteous prophet of God, was worried about what he
                was seeing. He prayed to God and asked that future generations and especially Noah's seed would be
                taught righteousness. God promised Enoch, creating the first recorded covenant in the scriptures, that
                Noah's seed would be flooded with righteousness in preparation for the return of Christ. This covenant
                with Enoch ensures that the everlasting covenant will be offered to all people in the latter days.</p>

            <h3>The Noahic Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">The Noahaic covenant is not much different from the Enochian covenant. In fact, it is a
                reaffirmation of the Enochian covenant with Noah. Noah's seed is the remnant of the chosen seed that
                will always be found here on earth, and the same seed that God talks about in the Enochian covenant. In
                this covenant with Noah, God promises that He will never again flood the earth with water. Instead, God
                will flood the earth with righteousness in preparation for Christ's return in the final days. God also
                offered the rainbow as a symbol of the covenant and reminder to all that He continues to keep His
                promise that was made with Noah.</p>

            <h3>Who Was Melchizedek?</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Melchizedek was a prototype king and priest within the order of the covenant God made
                with Enoch. While there was not a specific covenant made between God and Melchizedek, it is still
                important to understand who Melchizedek was.</p>

            <p class="w3-mobile">Melchizedek was a man of great faith. He sought righteousness in all aspects of his
                life, especially when it came to being a king. His people called him the Prince of peace or King of
                peace. Melchizedek was approved of God and became a High Priest. As King and High Priest, Melchizedek
                put at defiance nations, did all things according to God's will, and subdued principalities and powers.
                Melchizedek did nothing except what was the will of God. These are the reasons why the highest order of
                the priesthood is called the Melchizedek Priesthood. This name is supposed to remind us of the nobility
                and righteousness that holders of the highest order of God's priesthood should possess.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Abraham: The Seeker</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile abraham" src="images/abraham_and_isaac-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <h3>The Abrahamic Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Abraham sought for the blessings of Enoch, Noah and Melchizedek. Abraham wanted to know
                how he could receive the blessings of the everlasting covenant. God eventually blessed Abraham with the
                blessings of the everlasting covenant, and even gave him the priesthood authority to give those same
                blessings to others. This all occurred after Abraham led his people to the land of Canaan. All of the
                blessings that Abraham was blessed with are known as the Abrahamic Covenant.</p>

            <p class="w3-mobile">These are the promises that were made to Abraham and his seed: 1) His posterity would
                be numerous. 2) His seed, would receive the gospel and bear the priesthood. 3) Through the ministry of
                his seed, all the families of the earth would be blessed with the blessings of the Gospel and of
                salvation. The covenant between Abraham and God was eventually renewed to Abraham's son Isaac and and
                grandson Jacob. Today Christ's Everlasting Gospel continues to reach the four corners of the earth
                because of the covenant that Abraham made.</p>

            <p class=" w3-mobile">If it were not for the Abrahamic Covenant, you and I would not have the opportunity to
                learn of and in turn teach of Christ. Christ's Plan of Salvation continues because of the righteous seed
                of Abraham.</p>

            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile moses" src="images/moses_parting_red_sea_barrett-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <h3>The House of Israel</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Moses is an important character in the Old Testament for many reasons. Moses and his
                brother Aaron were successful in freeing the Israelites from Pharaoh's oppressive rule. The once
                enslaved Israelites then became Moses' people. He led them with the help of the Lord and taught them
                many things. One of this dispensations highlights is when Moses went up to Mount Sinai for 40 days and
                there received the Ten Commandments. However, upon returning to the Israelites, Moses found that they
                had fallen away from God and began worshipping idols. Moses was lost and knew not what to do, so he went
                back up to a high place, this being Mount Sinai. The Lord revealed unto Moses a law lesser than the Ten
                Commandments, and more strict. This law is known as the Law of Moses.</p>
            <p>The Lord had a plan for Moses and the Israelites and this plan included them building a tabernacle or
                temple. The Lord desired that Moses and the Israelites worship Him in this temple and use it to become
                prepared to enter into the promised land. For 40 years Moses and the Israelites wandered in the
                wilderness before they were permitted to enter into the promised land.</p>

            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile david" src="images/david_goliath-300px.jpg" alt="David slays Goliath.">
            <h3>David vs. Goliath</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">The stroy of David defeating Goliath is well known, however, David's story becomes less known after his victory. The prophet Samuel was instructed by God to anoint a new king of the Israelites that would replace Saul. Saul, the current king, had become corrupt, and the Lord wanted to replace him. After David defeated Goliath, Saul invited David to come live with him. From then on, David acquired fame and become very popular among the people of Israel. Saul eventually died, and David became the king of Israel.</p>
            <h3>The Davidic Covenant</h3>
            <p>David saw a great need to place the Ark of the Covenant in a holy place. He proposed that his people build a beautiful temple for the Ark of the Covenant, but the Lord refused teh offering. Instead, the Lord covenanted with David that his kingdom and posterity would last forever <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/7?lang=eng"><span class="scriptures">(2 Samuel 7)</span></a>. However, David would not be the one who's kingdom would be established forever. Instead, Christ would come from David's seed, set up His kingdom here on earth, and this would be the kingdom that would be established forever.</p><br><br>
            <h3>David's Fall</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Unfortunately, the story of David ends in a much less brilliant way then it started. David fell into the sin of adultery with Bathsheba, and he continued to fight with the consequences of this sin until the end of his life. This is perhaps the greatest lesson that was taught by David to his people and us; we must endure to the end. It does not matter how righteous of a life you live if you cannot endure to the end and remain faithful and loyal to God unto the end. David showed us how damaging sin can be to our spirits and it is our job to learn from his mistakes. David's reign however, was vital to God's plan for His children and for His only begotten son Jesus Christ. Through David Christ was able to lead a life here on earth where the promise made to David was fulfilled when Christ established His everlasting kingdom and Gospel here on earth.</p>

                God wanted His people to be free and safe, so He called a prophet to lead them to safety. Today, God
                continues to call prophets that lead His people to a "promised land". The Lord will continue to call
                prophets until He returns to earth to reign forever.</p>

            <h3>The House of Israel</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Moses is an important character in the Old Testament for many reasons. Moses and his
                brother Aaron were successful in freeing the Israelites from Pharaoh's oppressive rule. The once
                enslaved Israelites then became Moses' people. He led them with the help of the Lord and taught them
                many things. One of this dispensations highlights is when Moses went up to Mount Sinai for 40 days and
                there received the Ten Commandments. However, upon returning to the Israelites, Moses found that they
                had fallen away from God and began worshipping idols. Moses was lost and knew not what to do, so he went
                back up to a high place, this being Mount Sinai. The Lord revealed unto Moses a law lesser than the Ten
                Commandments, and more strict. This law is known as the Law of Moses.</p>
            <p>The Lord had a plan for Moses and the Israelites and this plan included them building a tabernacle or
                temple. The Lord desired that Moses and the Israelites worship Him in this temple and use it to become
                prepared to enter into the promised land. For 40 years Moses and the Israelites wandered in the
                wilderness before they were permitted to enter into the promised land.</p>
            <h3>A Cardinal Dispensation</h3>
            <p> This dispensation is so important because the Lord set a standard for His people and showed them very

                continues to call prophets that lead His people to a "promised land". The Lord will continue to call
                prophets until He returns to earth to reign forever.</p>
