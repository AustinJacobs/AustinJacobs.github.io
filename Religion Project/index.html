            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Adam & Eve: Our First Parents</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile adameve" src="images/adam_eve-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <p class="w3-mobile">Adam and Eve were the first of God's children here on earth. As we know, Adam and Eve were forced out of the Garden of Eden after partaking of the forbidden fruit. This caused them to become mortal, susceptible to sickness, injury and worse; sin.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Luckily, the fall of Adam and Eve was part of God's plan. Satan was not aware that God had prepared for this to happen to Adam and Eve. God had already created a Plan of Salvation for Adam, Eve and all of His children that would ultimately be born on earth. This plan required Adam and Eve to have children, create and strengthen a relationship with God even though they were not in His presence, and finally, teach their children.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Today, we are part of the family that Adam and Eve created. We are still cut off from God's presence, but we do have a knowledge of Jesus Christ and God who is our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ taught His Gospel long ago when He ministered here on earth. Adam and Eve were the first to learn of Christ's Gospel, and they even began to make promises and complete ordinances like baptism. Adam and Eve, over their life, learned to progress and become better people. This is the point of our lives.</p>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Through the Plan of Salvation, we are able to fulfill all of the ordinances that God wants us to complete here on earth. We have Christ's Gospel to teach us how to act. As we strive to live righteously as Adam and Eve did, we can return to God's presence where we will no longer be cut off from Him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container w3-padding-16" id="two">
            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Enoch, Noah & Melchizedek: The Fathers</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile enoch" src="images/noah_and_animals-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <h3>The Enochian Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">During the time that Enoch, Noah and Melchizedek were on the earth, there were an innumerable amount of wicked people. In fact, these wicked people began to persecute the righteous, and especially Noah. It just so happened that Enoch, a righteous prophet of God, was worried about what he was seeing. He prayed to God and asked that future generations and especially Noah's seed would be taught righteousness. God promised Enoch, creating the first recorded covenant in the scriptures, that Noah's seed would be flooded with righteousness in preparation for the return of Christ. This covenant with Enoch ensures that the everlasting covenant will be offered to all people in the latter days.</p>

            <h3>The Noahic Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">The Noahaic covenant is not much different from the Enochian covenant. In fact, it is a reaffirmation of the Enochian covenant with Noah. Noah's seed is the remnant of the chosen seed that will always be found here on earth, and the same seed that God talks about in the Enochian covenant. In this covenant with Noah, God promises that He will never again flood the earth with water. Instead, God will flood the earth with righteousness in preparation for Christ's return in the final days. God also offered the rainbow as a symbol of the covenant and reminder to all that He continues to keep His promise that was made with Noah.</p>

            <h3>Who Was Melchizedek?</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Melchizedek was a prototype king and priest within the order of the covenant God made with Enoch. While there was not a specific covenant made between God and Melchizedek, it is still important to understand who Melchizedek was.</p>

            <p class="w3-mobile">Melchizedek was a man of great faith. He sought righteousness in all aspects of his life, especially when it came to being a king. His people called him the Prince of peace or King of peace. Melchizedek was approved of God and became a High Priest. As King and High Priest, Melchizedek put at defiance nations, did all things according to God's will, and subdued principalities and powers. Melchizedek did nothing except what was the will of God. These are the reasons why the highest order of the priesthood is called the Melchizedek Priesthood. This name is supposed to remind us of the nobility and righteousness that holders of the highest order of God's priesthood should possess.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center w3-mobile">Abraham: The Seeker</h2>
            <img class="w3-image w3-mobile abraham" src="images/abraham_and_isaac-300.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve">
            <h3>The Abrahamic Covenant</h3>
            <p class="w3-mobile">Abraham sought for the blessings of Enoch, Noah and Melchizedek. Abraham wanted to know how he could receive the blessings of the everlasting covenant. God eventually blessed Abraham with the blessings of the everlasting covenant, and even gave him the priesthood authority to give those same blessings to others. This all occurred after Abraham led his people to the land of Canaan. All of the blessings that Abraham was blessed with are known as the Abrahamic Covenant.</p>

            <p class="w3-mobile">These are the promises that were made to Abraham and his seed: 1) His posterity would be numerous. 2) His seed, would receive the gospel and bear the priesthood. 3) Through the ministry of his seed, all the families of the earth would be blessed with the blessings of the Gospel and of salvation. The covenant between Abraham and God was eventually renewed to Abraham's son Isaac and and grandson Jacob. Today Christ's Everlasting Gospel continues to reach the four corners of the earth because of the covenant that Abraham made.</p>

            <p class=" w3-mobile">If it were not for the Abrahamic Covenant, you and I would not have the opportunity to learn of and in turn teach of Christ. Christ's Plan of Salvation continues because of the righteous seed of Abraham.</p>
